//Interface contain public abstract methods and public static final variables by default
// In interface, we can define abstract methods only but implement those methods into implement class
// We can't create object of interface
// interface does not have constructor
// before 1.7 , interface does not have method body
// in 1.8 , declare the default and static method with body in interface
// in 1.9 , we can define private methods in interface
// multiple inheritance is supported in interface not in abstract class

public interface Example{

	public abstract void x1();
	
	//public static final int a = 20; 
	
}
