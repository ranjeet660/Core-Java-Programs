//One entity that differently behaves in different cases is called.
//Method Overriding:
//			It is same method name with same parameters in different class is called.
//			There is need of parent class and child class relationship
//			Is also called late, dynamic binding & run time polymorphism
//		Rule- Method name must have same
//				argument / parameter must have same
//				access specifier is anything
//				parameter is anything
//		Note- We can extend scope of method but we cant reduce the scope of method
