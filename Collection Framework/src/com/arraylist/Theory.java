//Framework- Why it called?
//  Becoz it is collection of classes and interfaces that works together so thats it is called Framework
//
// Need of collection-
//	Array-
// 	1) Array are fixed in size, once it is created then it can't be changed in size
//  2) array are holds homogeneous data elements.
//	3) There are no in built methods available in array

//  Collection-
//	1) Collection is growable in nature, we can increase/ decrease size.
//  2) Collection are holds homogeneous and heterogeneous data elements.
//	3) there are in built methods available in collection
// 4) Every classes is implemented based on  some data structure 

//			Array										Collection
//  1) Fixed in size							| 1) Growable in nature
//	2) array are holds homogeneous elements		| 2) It is holds homo. as well hetero. elements
//	3) No in built methods available			| 3) in built methods available in collection
//	4) Array holds both primitives data types	| 4) It is holds only objects not primitives data types
//		& objects 

//Collection-
//    If we want to represent group of individual objects as single entity(Class) then go for Collection.
//	  Collection interface is defined most common methods which are applicable for any collection object
//    Collection interface is considered as root interface of collection framework
//    There is no noncreate class which implemented collection interface directly.

// 9 key interfaces -
// 1) Collection --> List--> Set--> Sorted Set--> NavigableSet--> Queue--> Map--> SortedMap--> NavigableMap
package com.arraylist;

public class Theory {
//ArrayList-
//	1) ArrayList is extends abstractList class and implements List inteface.
//	2) Duplicates are allowed
//	3) Null insertion is possible
//	4) Heterogeneous objects are allowed
//	5) Insertion order is preserved.
//	6) Arraylist is best choice if frequent operation is retrieval operation
//	7) It is wrost choice if our frequent operation is addition/ insertion or deleteion operation
